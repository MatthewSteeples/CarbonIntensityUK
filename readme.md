# UK Carbon Intensity
.NET wrapper around the British Carbon Intensity API provided by the National Grid. Provides real-time and calculated (+48 hour forecast) of CO2 carbon emissions relating to electricity generation.

> The Carbon Intensity API uses state-of-the-art Machine Learning and sophisticated power system modelling to forecast the carbon intensity and generation mix 96+ hours ahead for each region in Great Britain. 
>Our OpenAPI allows consumers and smart devices to schedule and minimise CO2 emissions at a local level
